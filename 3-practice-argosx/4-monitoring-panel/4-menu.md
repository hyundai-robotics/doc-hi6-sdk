# 3.4.4 Injecting a panel item into the panel menu

Let's inject the ArgosX monitoring function into the panel menu.

Add a panel item into the ui/menu.json file as follows.

menu.json
``` json
[
   {
       "path": "system/appl/",
       "id": "argosx",
       "icon": "argosx/ui/lm_argosx.png",
       "label": "ArgosX Vision",
       "url": "argosx/ui/setup.html"
   },
   {
      "path": "panels",
      "id": "argosx",
      "icon": "argosx/ui/panel_argosx.png",
      "label": "ArgosX Vision",
      "url": "argosx/ui/panel.html"
  }
]
```

Letâ€™s make a picture icon that will be injected into the panel menu. A png icon with a transparent 40 x 40-pixel background would be sufficient.

Here, we just made panel_argosx.png by scaling down the existing lm_argosx.png properly and adjusting the colors.

Now, let's run the virtual mainboard and virtual teach pendant.


When you open the panel menu to add a new panel item, you can see the newly added ArogsX Vision menu item.

When you select the menu, the monitoring panel we made will appear shortly.

Let's execute requests and responses by operating the virtual teach pendant. If the n.request and n.response values increase, it means the operation is normal.
