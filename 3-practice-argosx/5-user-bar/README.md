# 3.5 Practical project: Developing an ArgosX user bar UI

In the previous chapters, we learned how to perform the functions implemented in the plug-ins using a robot language.

However, in some cases, it may be necessary to provide a function for the user to directly operate the UI to call the functions of a plug-in. These operating buttons can be provided on the setup window or monitoring window. However, a user bar would be suitable for quick operations on the teaching screen.
